	       IF THE CURRENT LOC IS ZERO, IT MEANS THE CLOWN GOT HIMSELF
	       KILLED.  WE'LL ALLOW THIS MAXDIE TIMES.  MAXDIE IS AUTOMATICALLY
	       SET BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SNIDE MESSAGES AVAILABLE.  EACH DEATH
	       RESULTS IN A MESSAGE (81, 83, ETC.)  WHICH OFFERS REINCARNATION;
	       IF ACCEPTED, THIS RESULTS IN MESSAGE 82, 84, ETC.  THE LAST
	       TIME, IF HE WANTS ANOTHER CHANCE, HE GETS A SNIDE REMARK AS WE
	       EXIT.  WHEN REINCARNATED, ALL OBJECTS BEING CARRIED GET DROPPED
	       AT OLDLC2 (PRESUMABLY THE LAST PLACE PRIOR TO BEING KILLED)
	       WITHOUT CHANGE OF PROPS.  THE LOOP RUNS BACKWARDS TO ASSURE THAT
	       THE BIRD IS DROPPED BEFORE THE CAGE.  (THIS KLUGE COULD BE
	       CHANGED ONCE WE'RE SURE ALL REFERENCES TO BIRD AND CAGE ARE D0NE
	       BY KEYWORDS.)  THE LAMP IS A SPECIAL CASE (IT WOULDN'T D0 TO
	       LEAVE IT IN THE CAVE).  IT IS TURNED OFF AND LEFT OUTSIDE THE
	       BUILDING (ONLY IF HE WAS CARRYING IT, OF COURSE).  HE HIMSELF
	       IS LEFT INSIDE THE BUILDING (AND HEAVEN HELP HIM IF HE TRIES TO
	       XYZZY BACK INTO THE CAVE WITHOUT THE LAMP!).  OLDLOC IS ZAPPED
	       SO HE CAN'T JUST "RETREAT".
