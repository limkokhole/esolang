blo

The blo programming language is a stripped-down programming language largely based on Go.  Types in blo are user defined structs, whose fields can be either a bit or a non-recursive user defined struct.

A blo program consists of type definitions and function definitions.  Execution begins with the main function.

Syntactically, blo resembles Go.

blo is statically typed.  Unlike Go, and like Java, all values are reference values.  However, references are never null -- values are allocated with all bits initialized to false when unassigned variables are first used.  Unreferenced values should be garbage collected.  Unlike Java, and like Go, struct fields are by value, not by reference, which is why recursive (including indirectly recursive) structs are not allowed.

Lexical structure

blo has a few keywords:

  type func var if else for break return set clear import

blo recognizes a few symbolic tokens:

  = { } ( ) . , ;

As with Go, newlines will be interpreted as semicolons when a semicolon is syntactically valid.

Whitespace separates tokens.

Comments can be non-nested block comments, delimited by /* and */, or line comments, starting with // and ending at the end of the line.

Non-keyword sequences of all other characters are identifier tokens.

Syntax

EBNF:

  program = { import-decl | type-decl | func-decl } ;

  import-decl = "import", ( type-decl | "func", identifier, "(", func-args, ")", [ identifier ], ";" ) ;

  type-decl = "type", identifier, "{", { struct-fields }, "}" ;

  struct-fields = identifier, { ",", identifier }, [ identifier ], ";" ;

  func-decl = "func", identifier, "(", func-args, ")", [ identifier ], statement-block ;

  func-args = [ func-arg, { ",", func-arg } ];

  func-arg = identifier, { ",", identifier }, identifier ;

  statment-block = "{", { statement }, "}" ;

  statement = statement-block | var-stmt | if-stmt | for-stmt | break-stmt | return-stmt | set-stmt | clear-stmt | assignment-stmt | expr-stmt ;

  var-stmt = "var", identifier, identifier, { "=", expression }, ";" ;

  if-stmt = "if", expression, statement-block, [ "else", ( if-stmt | statement-block ) ] ;

  for-stmt = "for", [ identifier ], statement-block ;

  break-stmt = "break", [ identifier ], ";" ;

  return-stmt = "return", [ expression ], ";" ;

  set-stmt = "set", expression, ";" ;

  clear-stmt = "clear", expression, ";" ;

  assignment-stmt = expression, "=", expression, ";" ;

  expr-stmt = expression, ";" ;

  expression = funcall-expr | identifier | ( expression, ".", identifier ) ;

  funcall-expr = identifier, "(", [ expression, { ",", expression } ], ")" ;

Import declarations

Import declaration: "import", ( type-decl | "func", identifier, "(", func-args, ")", [ identifier ], ";" ) ;

Import declarations are used to access types and functions in the run-time libarary, for, for example, doing I/O.

Type declarations

Type declaration: "type", identifier, "{", { struct-fields }, "}" ;

The identifier is the type name.  The type is a struct with 0 or more fields.

The struct fields: identifier1, { ",", identifier2 }, [ identifier3 ], ";" ;

The identifier1 is the field name.  The identifier2s are optional additional field name of additional fields with the same type.  The optional identifier3 is the type of the field.  If the type is not specified, the fields are single bits.

Function declarations

Function declaration: "func", identifier1, "(", func-args, ")", [ identifier2 ], statement-block ;

The identifier1 is the name of the function.  The optional identifier2 is the return type.  If the return type is not specified, the function returns no value and the function may only be used at the top level of an expr-statement.

Function declaration arguments: [ func-arg, { ",", func-arg } ]

A function may be declared to take 0 or more arguments.

Function declaration arguments: identifier1, { ",", identifier2 }, identifier3 ;

The identifier1 is the name of the argument.  The identifer2s are the names of optional additional arguments with the same type.  The identifier3 is the type of the argument(s).

Statements

Statement block: "{", { statement }, "}" ;

A statement block introduces a new scope for local variable declarations.

Variable declaration statement: "var", identifier1, identifier2, { "=", expression }, ";" ;

The identifier1 is the name of the variable.  The identifier2 is the type of the variable.  The variable may optionally be initialized to refer to the value of the expression.  Otherwise, the variable is a null reference until it is either assigned to refer to a value, or the variable is dereferenced, at which time it is automatically set to a reference to a newly allocated value with all its bits cleared.

A variable name must be unique in its scope-- shadowing is not allowed.

If statement: "if", expression, statement-block1, [ "else", ( if-stmt | statement-block2 ) ] ;

The expression must ultimately be a field of unnamed (bit) type.  If the expression evaluates to true, the statement-block1 is executed, otherwise, the optional else clause is executed.

For statement: "for", [ identifier ], statement-block ;

The identifier is an optional label for break statements.  The statement-block is executed in an infinite loop, unless exited with a break or return statement.

Break statement: "break", [ identifier ], ";" ;

The optional identifier is the label of an enclosing for statement to exit.  If the label is absent, the innermost for statement is exited.

Return statment: "return", [ expression ], ";" ;

The return returns a reference to the value of the expression, the type of which must be the same as the declared return type of the enclosing func.  If the func does not return a value, the expression must be omitted.

If the end of the main statement block of a func is reachable, then the func returns when execution reaches the end of the block.  This is only permitted if the func does not return a value.  A func that has a declared return type must return a value of the return type or loop forever.

Set statement: "set", expression, ";" ;

The expression must ultimately be a field of unnamed (bit) type, which is set to true.

Clear statement: "clear", expression, ";" ;

The expression must ultimately be a field of unnamed (bit) type, which is cleared to false.

Assignment statment: expression, "=", expression, ";" ;

If the left expression is a single identifier, it is a local variable and the local variable will be set to a reference to the value of the right expression, with no bits being copied.

If the left expression is function call or ultimately a field reference, then the bits of the value of the right expression are copied into the value of the left expression.  Due to the type system, partial overlap of the left and right values are not possible -- the bits would either completely overlap or be completely disjoint.

Example illustrating the different assignment statements:

  type flag {
      f
  }

  func f() {
      var a flag
      var b flag
      var c flag
      set a.f
      b = a // b references the same bit as a
      c.f = a.f // c references a different bit than a
      clear a.f
      if b.f {
          // not reached
      }
      if c.f {
          // reached
      }
  }

Expression statement: expression, ";" ;

An expression statements evaluates the expression.  Its value is discarded.

Expressions

Expression: funcall-expr | identifier1 | ( expression, ".", identifier2 ) ;

An expression can be a function call, a local variable (the identifier2 is the name of the local variable), or field access of an expression (the identifier2 is the name of the field).

Function call: identifier, "(", [ expression, { ",", expression } ], ")" ;

The identifier is the name of the function being called.

Runtime libarary

The runtime libarary may provide implementation-dependent types and functions that programs may access by using import statements.

Imported types may include opaque data that is not directly accessible, which could be used for holding and manipulating strings and other variable-length data.  User defined structs may have fields of such (or any other) imported types, provided that they are non-recursive.

Reference runtine library

  // putByte outputs one byte to standard output.  Takes one argument,
  // which may be declared as any type, from which it interprets the first
  // 8 bits as a little-endian byte.  If the type has fewer than 8 bits,
  // the higher bits are set to 0.
  import func putByte(b anytype)

  // getByte reads one byte from standard input.  Takes one argument,
  // which may be declared as any type, into which it stores the read
  // byte in the first 8 bits as little-endian and stores the EOF flag
  // in the 9th bit.  If the type has fewer than 9 bits, then the
  // remaining data are discarded.
  import func getByte(b anytype)

Example

Hello world:

  import func putByte(b byte)

  type byte { 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 40, 80 }

  func main() {
      var b byte
      set b.40
      set b.8
      putByte(b) // H = 48
      clear b.8
      set b.20
      set b.4
      set b.1
      putByte(b) // e = 65
      clear b.1
      set b.8
      putByte(b) // l = 6c
      putByte(b)
      set b.1
      set b.2
      putByte(b) // o = 6f
      var c byte
      set c.20
      putByte(c) // SPC = 20
      set b.10
      clear b.8
      putByte(b) // w = 77
      clear b.10
      set b.8
      putByte(b) // o = 6f
      set b.10
      clear b.8
      clear b.4
      clear b.1
      putByte(b) // r = 72
      clear b.10
      clear b.2
      set b.8
      set b.4
      putByte(b) // l = 6c
      clear b.8
      putByte(b) // d = 64
      set c.1
      putByte(c) // ! = 21
      clear c.20
      clear c.1
      set c.8
      set c.2
      putByte(c) // \n = 0a
  }

Cat:

  import func putByte(b byte)
  import func getByte(b byte)

  type byte { 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 40, 80, EOF }

  func main() {
      for {
          var b byte
          getByte(b)
          if b.EOF {
              break
          }
          putByte(b)
      }
  }

Implementation notes

Since blo data structures cannot contain pointers, only local variables contain pointers.  Functions can also return pointers, but they can be implemented by having the caller allocate the return value and passing in a pointer for the return value.  So, while values can outlive the scope of the local variable that allocated them by being assigned to another local variable or by being returned from the function, by using caller allocation of return values, all allocations can be on the stack.

In the absence of loops and function calls, the space for all local variables can be allocated on the function entry, and each local variable can point to a single distinct location within that allocation.  However, loops and function calls means it is not that simple.  First, when looping, a local variable in the loop scope can be aliased by a local variable outside of the loop scope, so, on subsequent iterations, it may need to point to a different allocation.  However, the aliases are limited to the number of local variables of that type or of types that contain (perhaps indirectly) that type, so the size of the allocation needed is still statically bound.  Second, function call subexpressions will need allocations for the return values, which, if in a loop, may also be aliased in subsequent loop iterations.  Still, the size of the allocation is statically bound.

A straightforward way handle local variable allocations is to allocate space for N copies of each local variable, including a reference count for each, where N is the number of possible aliases.  When a var statement is encountered, check the reference count of each allocated space until finding one with zero references, increment that reference, and use that space for the variable.  Similarly for the return values of function call subexpressions.

Aliasing also complicate the handling of the return values of functions.  If the value being returned is a locally allocated value, there is no problem with simply copying the value to the caller-allocated return value.  However, if the value being returned aliases a parameter that was passed in, then the return value must also alias that parameter.  To illustrate, an example:

  type a { a }
  type b { a a }
  func f(b b) a { return b.a }

  func main() {
    var v b
    set f(v).a
    if v.a.a {
      // reached
    } else {
      // not reached
    }
  }

If the return value f were copied into the caller allocated-space for the return value, then the if would erroneously take the else branch.

So, functions that return a value would have a caller-allocated space for the return value passed in, and also return a pointer to the actual return value, which can either be the passed-in allocation for the return value, or an alias to one of the passed-in parameters.

The implemention of the return statement will check if the return value aliases one of the passed in parameters, and if it does, return that alias, otherwise, copy the value into the caller-allocated space for the return value, and return the pointer to that space.

Since subfields may be aliased, an implementation of local variables can be a pointer to the allocation of the reference count and the bit array plus an offset index to the first bit of the value.

The reference count of passed in parameters should not require special handling, since the counts at exit should be the same at the counts on entry.

Also, note that the reference counts need to be looked at only for var statements and function calls within loops to determine whether the space can be recycled.  One optimization could be to dispense with reference counting in functions without loops, or with only loops without var statements or function calls.

Additionally, if escape analysis determines that a local variable value or a value returned from a function does not escape the loop, then only a single copy needs to be allocated, since its reference count would always be zero at the top of the loop for every iteration.

Since the maximum reference count within a call frame can be statically determined, only a few bits need to be devoted to the reference counts.  However, since an arbitrarily large call stack can lead to an arbitrarily large number of references to a value that gets passed down the call stack, the counts can become arbitrarily large.  Still, as long as the overflow and underflow reversibly wrap around, no special treatment is needed, since the reference count is never checked in call frames other than the frame of the original allocation.
